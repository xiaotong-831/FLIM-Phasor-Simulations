# FLIM Phasor Simulations and Analysis 

This repository contains code to **simulate fluorescence decays, time gates, and how different approaches to analyze FLIM data including curve fitting, weighted lifetime, and phasor analysis affect the measurement accuracy**. 

## Single exponential decay simulation 

The 'Single_exponential_decay_simulations.py' simulates fluorescence decay characteristics of single lifetime molecular species. The code invetsigates how the three different data analysis approaches: curve fitting, weighted lifetime, phasor analysis method, affect the measurement accuracy. We also change the simulation parameters: gate width, gate delay, and the total detected photons, to study how system settings affect the acquisition speed, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and overall quality and performance of the measurement.
